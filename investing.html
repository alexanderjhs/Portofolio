                    <p>
                        The wrong website can kill your business!<br><br> These days, your website is one of the first things a prospect will look for when dealing with your business. They don’t ask for business cards or your physical address: they ask for your website address.
                        <br><br> In short: <b>if you’re website is not setup for success or you’re not online, you’re not in business.</b>
                        <br><br> One mistake many business owners make is thinking that any website will do. After all, if you build it, they will come. That approach can be disastrous! In addition, not having a website is better than having a bad one.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why?</h2>
                    <hr class="black">
                    <p>
                        <u>A great website</u> has the ability to impact how your target market and prospects view your business. First impressions count, and great website design goes that extra mile, 24/7:
                        <br><br>
                        <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"> <b>Establish credibility</b></i><br>
                        <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"> <b>Build trust</b></i><br>
                        <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"> <b>Engage visitors</b></i><br>
                        <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"> <b>Generate Leads</b></i><br>
                        <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"> <b>Support your customers</b></i><br>
                        <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"> <b>Close more sales</b></i>
                        <br><br> Putting all this together leads to one result: an increase in your business revenue and bottom line.
                        <br><br> However, many small business owners simply throw together a website with very little thought or strategy on how the site will impact lead generation, customer acquisition and sales. In short, a website with no clear direction.
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Building a website with a clear goal and strategy</u> will help you to increase leads and sales, ultimately helping you grow your business. Even better, your website is visible 24/7, making it a valuable marketing asset.
                        <br><br> Here are the top five reasons why you need a website:

                    </p>
                    <h2>Establish a Web Presence</h2>
                    <hr class="black">
                    <p>
                        <u>Establishing an online presence</u> provides a digital storefront for your business whether you already have a physical location or are a home-based business.
                        <br><br> For businesses that have a physical location, a website helps you to tap into the online market—something that helps you increase your revenue by increasing your reach.
                        <br><br> If you are a home-based business, then establishing an online presence is essential. It’s one of the easiest ways to legitimize your business while providing your target audience with a point of reference.

                    </p>

                    <h2>Need more convincing?</h2>
                    <hr class="black">
                    <p>
                        Internet sales account for a huge portion or revenue for retailers such as Neiman Marcus and Michael Kors alongside their physical locations which are dotted all over the country. Smaller businesses can enjoy the very same with a great website.
                        <br><br> A great website solidifies your business, builds trust, and gives your prospects confidence to take the next step with you and make a purchasing decision. Without an online presence, your business simply misses out on a huge opportunity.
                        <br><br> Do you really want to leave the door closed when opportunity comes knocking?
                    </p>

                    <h2>Provide Information</h2>
                    <hr class="black">
                    <p>
                        If you sell a product or provide a service where there are a lot of frequently asked questions or demonstrations needed, a website is an amazingly effective tool that delivers information on demand.
                        <br><br> Using your website as a tool is an excellent choice: it will serve your prospects and customers the information that they want instantaneously— and free up your time.
                        <br><br> In some cases, just having that information makes it easy to qualify serious prospects and bring them closer to the sale.
                        <br><br>

                    </p>

                    <h2>Market Your Business Online</h2>
                    <hr class="black">
                    <p>

                        There is simply no other form of marketing as effective as a website when it comes to selling your business. A website puts you right in front of people who are searching for your services right when they need it—something that influences their behavior immensely.
                        <br><br> An entrepreneur could literally launch a business today and start getting new customers online tomorrow. Thousands do every week!
                        <br><br> This is the sheer power of internet marketing. However, if you want to capitalize on this phenomenon, you need a website which is built with the right strategy in place to take advantage of the myriad opportunities available to you and your business.
                        <br><br> If you’re not showing up online, you’re losing business, period.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Generate Leads</h2>
                    <hr class="black">
                    <p>
                        A website has a tremendous capacity to help you generate leads for your business, whether you are advertising online or offline.
                        <br><br> By using your website with free giveaways and tempting offers, you can increase your lead generation and build a prospect list. How many people will buy at the first interaction with your ad? Probably not as many as you dream of, but the key is in getting them into your marketing funnel.
                        <br><br> Your funnel works simply by generating a lead first, then following up to close the sale. Your website is the perfect tool to help you accomplish this goal by putting much of this process—you can virtually automate your entire marketing. Not only does this drive efficiency, it also increases your productivity.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Generate Sales</h2>
                    <hr class="black">

                    <p>
                        Whether you have a brick and mortar store or an online business, whether you sell a product or a service, having a great website is one of the best tools your business can have. With the capacity to boost your sales and bottom line, a great website works for your business 24/7 while you sleep.
